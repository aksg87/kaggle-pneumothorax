# pneumothorax-segmentation
Experimenting with data partitioning for pneumothorax detection using Fast.ai and Kaggle dataset.

Some results on positive patches with pneumothorax.

#### Note: Combining these results into a single x-ray will lead to issues at the patch edges.

Recently published work may address this type if limitation: https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/ultra-high-resolution-image-analysis.html


#### Note: This repository is currently incomplete. 
Todo:
-Pipeline for running inference.
-Optimizing thresholds for determining a negative x-ray.
